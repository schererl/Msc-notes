# Novelty Heuristic

- [ ] **Read** the paper [A Novelty-based Heuristic for Problem Solving](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/11027).
- [ ] **Implement** novelty in Pytrich using `<(h,t,f), h>`.
- [ ] **Compare** novelty with the original heuristic `h`.
- [ ] **Implement** the novelty approach in **PANDA**.

**Expectations**  
Find out if novelty can:
- Contribute to solving more problems in general, or  
- At least provide an advantage in specific domains.

# Work on Landmarks

## Experiments on Mandatory Tasks

Isolate the set of mandatory tasks found by the bottom-up approach and see differences in performance of:
- MT
- BU
- IBU (isolated bottom-up)

## Experiments on Landmark Updates

Test if landmark updates can be effective, running an extended version in PANDA.

**Expectations**  
Landmark updates are a fast way to generate more landmarks without the need for full recomputation, thus this approach could add information without compromising the heuristicâ€™s role.

---

## Usage of Bidirectional Landmarks in State-of-the-Art PANDA

- [x] **Implement** bidirectional landmarks in **PANDA-lama**.
- [ ] **Run** experiments comparing bidirectional landmarks with LM-Cut and bottom-up approaches.

**Expectations**  
Determine if bidirectional landmarks enhance the performance of state-of-the-art planners.

# Organization

## Merge the PANDA Projects

- [ ] Merge **panda-lama** and **Dealer** into a single GitHub repository.
- [ ] Organize files and scripts in a coherent structure.
- [ ] Standardize the parser and grounder so they can work in both.
